### Example Queries
The following examples illustrate the types of educational queries this challenge addresses, along with expected transparent responses:

Query: This semester, I scored 8 points on the final exam for the DSA course. However, I was absent for the lab exam. Can I still get a B in this course?
Expected Response: This semester, I scored 8 points on the final exam for the DSA course. However, I was absent for the lab exam. Can I still get a B in this course?

Query: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the following circuit, given that each resistor has a resistance of r
Expected Response: Since the resistors are connected together at both ends, the circuit can be redrawn to show that the three resistors are connected in parallel. Therefore, the equivalent resistance is: R = r / 3

### Challenge Objectives
The primary goal of this challenge is to build educational QA systems that not only produce accurate answers but also provide clear, verifiable reasoning for how those answers were derived. Specifically, we seek to:

- Encourage (but not require) the use of symbolic reasoning tools such as Z3, custom solvers, or other logic-based engines alongside LLMs
- Extend XAI research into STEM domains such as physics (electric circuits)
- Provide benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks to support future developments in explainable AI for education

### What You'll Build
Participating teams will develop systems that:

- Provide correct final answers to educational queries
- Generate natural language explanations that justify each answer
- Optionally provide additional supporting evidence, such as First-Order Logic (FOL) derivations, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, premise lists, or other structured proofs, to strengthen the system's reasoning depth
- Use any approach, including symbolic reasoning, neurosymbolic methods, fine-tuned LLMs, or any combination, as long as the system can explain how it arrived at each answer

### DO:
Provide Explainable Answers
Every generated answer must be accompanied by a natural language explanation that justifies how the answer was derived. The explanation should be concise, interpretable, and verifiable.

Encouraged: Use a Symbolic Engine
Teams are encouraged to incorporate symbolic reasoning (e.g., Z3 Solver or a custom-built engine) to verify and explain answers. However, this is not mandatory. Any approach that produces explainable results is accepted.

Use Open-Source LLMs
All LLMs used in the system must be open-source and have 8 billion parameters or fewer. This applies to any LLM component, whether used for answer generation, reasoning, or Natural Language to Logic conversion.

### DO NOT:
Use Closed-Source Models
The use of commercial or closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) is strictly prohibited. Submissions that rely on closed-source models will be disqualified.

Hide External Data Sources
All external datasets used for fine-tuning LLMs or Symbolic Engines must be fully disclosed. Failure to disclose external data usage will result in disqualification.

### Dataset Type 1: Logic-Based Educational Queries
This dataset contains 464 records with a total of 913 questions designed to evaluate logical reasoning in educational contexts. Topics cover university regulations such as grading policies, course enrollment rules, scholarship criteria, and academic requirements. Question types include Multiple Choice, Yes/No/Uncertain, and open-ended queries. Each record includes a set of premises in both natural language and FOL, along with derived questions, ground-truth answers, and human-written explanations. During evaluation, the system receives the question together with the natural language premises (premises-NL) as input. Teams are free to use the premises in any way (e.g., as prompt context, for FOL conversion, etc.).

```json
{
  "premises-NL": [
    "If a curriculum is well-structured and has exercises, it enhances student engagement.",
    "If a curriculum enhances student engagement and provides access to advanced resources, it enhances critical thinking.",
    "If a faculty prioritizes pedagogical training and curriculum development, the curriculum is well-structured.",
    "The faculty prioritizes pedagogical training and curriculum development.",
    "The curriculum has practical exercises.",
    "The curriculum provides access to advanced resources."
  ],
  "premises-FOL": [
    "ForAll(c, (well_structured(c) ∧ has_exercises(c)) → enhances_engagement(c))",
    "ForAll(c, (enhances_engagement(c) ∧ advanced_resources(c)) → enhances_critical_thinking(c))",
    "..."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Based on the premises, what can we conclude about the curriculum?\nA. It enhances student engagement but not critical thinking\nB. It enhances critical thinking\nC. It needs more resources to enhance critical thinking\nD. It is well-structured but lacks exercises",
    "Does the combination of faculty priorities and curriculum features lead to enhanced critical thinking?"
  ],
  "answers": ["B", "Yes"],
  "explanation": [
    "Premise 4 and premise 3 confirm the curriculum is well-structured. Premise 5 provides exercises, so premise 1 implies enhanced engagement. Premise 6 adds advanced resources, and premise 2 confirms enhanced critical thinking, supporting option B.",
    "Faculty priorities satisfy premise 3, making the curriculum well-structured. Exercises (premise 5) and premise 1 lead to enhanced engagement, and with advanced resources (premise 6), premise 2 confirms enhanced critical thinking."
  ]
}
```

### Dataset Type 2: Physics Problems
This dataset contains 5,520 text-based physics problems focusing on electric circuits and electrostatics. Topics include resistance, voltage, current, power, capacitance, electric fields, and energy calculations. Questions are numerical, requiring multi-step computation. Each problem comes with step-by-step CoT reasoning and a final numerical answer with its unit. During evaluation, the system receives only the question as input. The source materials (textbooks, knowledge references) used to construct this dataset will be announced at the kick-off workshop. 
Actually this dataset is csv
```json
{
  "id": "TD401",
  "question": "Calculate the energy stored in capacitor C when C = 100 μF and U = 30 V.",
  "cot": "Step 1: Identify the given values for capacitance (C) and voltage (U).\nStep 2: Recall the formula for energy: E = 0.5 * C * U^2.\nStep 3: Convert capacitance to Farads: C = 100 μF = 1 × 10^-4 F.\nStep 4: Substitute: E = 0.5 × (1 × 10^-4) × (30)^2.",
  "answer": "45",
  "unit": "J"
}
```

### Evaluation Criteria
P1: Correctness of Answers. Generating accurate and precise answers for the given queries
P2: Quality of Explanation. Providing a clear, coherent natural language explanation that justifies the answer
P3: Depth of Reasoning. Demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities through additional supporting evidence, such as FOL derivations, CoT steps, premise identification, or other structured proofs

### Submission Requirements
Each team must submit an API endpoint along with a brief solution description (1 page) detailing their approach, models used, and the dataset used for training. For each query, the API must return the required fields below. Teams are encouraged to include optional fields that demonstrate the depth of their system's reasoning. Richer evidence will have an advantage in the evaluation, particularly in the final round where the Challenge Chairs assess reasoning depth live.

```json
{
  // Required (Mandatory)
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The voltage across R2 is calculated using ...",

  // Optional (Encouraged)
  "fol": "∀x (Resistor(x) → HasVoltage(x, V))",
  "cot": [
    "Step 1: Identify the circuit topology ...",
    "Step 2: Apply Kirchhoff's voltage law ...",
    "Step 3: Solve for the unknown voltage ..."
  ],
  "premises": [
    "Ohm's law: V = IR",
    "KVL: sum of voltages in a loop = 0"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```
### Test Format
The official test set will combine both dataset types into a single unified set. For Type 1 queries, the system receives the question along with natural language premises; for Type 2 queries, the system receives the question only. Questions will include multiple-choice, Yes/No/Uncertain, open-ended reasoning, and numerical computation problems. The topic distribution (percentage of each dataset type) will be announced at the kick-off workshop.
